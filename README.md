This is a fairly basic viewer for Eve's Market data, from CREST.

You'll need to register an application on https://developers.eveonline.com/ with the callback url pointing at the directory you put this in (or at whatever you rename index.html to)
You'll also need to update the clientid to your applications id, and update the callback url



This depends on xdr.js (I got mine from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/master/src/xdr.js) and moment.js (http://momentjs.com/) to be in the same directory
